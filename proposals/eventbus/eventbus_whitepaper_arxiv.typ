*Abstract.*
Flourine is an event bus architecture that separates payload durability from ordering and coordination: payload bytes are stored in object storage, while offsets, deduplication state, and reader-group ownership are stored in a transactional metadata service. This paper specifies the implemented data-plane and control-plane algorithms, states formal safety properties, and delineates non-guarantees. It also compares Flourine with Kafka, Redpanda, and Bufstream across dimensions that matter in production design reviews: region-failure availability posture, exactly-once scope, schema enforcement and evolution, type-system flexibility, and consumer-group behavior. The emphasis is implementation-grounded semantics.

= Introduction

Most event buses collapse durability, ordering, and coordination into one replicated-log substrate. Flourine uses a split architecture: object storage for payload durability and transactional metadata for ordering and group state. This decomposition yields a simple broker role and explicit transaction boundaries, but it creates a two-system failure boundary between payload and metadata commits.

This paper focuses on concrete claims that can be tied to implementation behavior.

Contributions:

- A formal model of append publication based on object persistence followed by transactional metadata commit.
- Code-grounded algorithms for append, read, and reader-group coordination.
- Proof sketches for implemented safety properties and explicit non-guarantees.
- A multi-dimensional comparison with Kafka, Redpanda, and Bufstream.

= System Model

== Components

Flourine has three runtime roles:

- *Broker:* stateless WebSocket endpoint for append, read, and reader-group APIs.
- *Object store:* durable batch payloads addressed by object key and byte range.
- *Metadata store:* transactional authority for partition offsets, batch index rows, writer dedup state, and reader-group leases.

== Data Model

Each successful flush publishes:

- object payload bytes,
- batch index rows `(topic, partition, schema, [start,end), key, byte_range, checksum)`,
- updated `next_offset` per partition,
- updated writer dedup state `(writer_id, last_seq, last_acks)`.

Offsets use half-open intervals `[start, end)`. `next_offset` is the next free logical slot.

== Availability Envelope

The broker layer is stateless; availability is dominated by metadata and object-store availability.

Deployment intent:

- metadata on a managed HA service with automatic write-leader failover (for example Aurora PostgreSQL-compatible deployments or Spanner-class services),
- object storage with cross-zone and optional cross-region durability (for example S3 or GCS classes configured for regional goals),
- brokers deployed in multiple regions behind failover-capable ingress.

Under this envelope, zone failure is expected to be transparent, and region failure tolerance depends on metadata writer failover time and object-store replication policy.

Artifact note: the current implementation uses PostgreSQL interfaces and an S3-compatible object-store abstraction; cross-region behavior is therefore deployment-configured, not hardcoded.

== Fault Model

Assumptions:

- crash-stop brokers,
- transient metadata-store and object-store failures,
- transient network partitions and delay.

No atomic distributed transaction spans object storage and metadata store.

== Schema and Type Model

Implemented behavior separates transport typing from payload typing:

- Wire protocol: Protobuf messages for control and RPC framing.
- Payload records: opaque bytes labeled by `schema_id` in each batch.
- Broker append path: no inline schema-registry lookup or compatibility check.
- Separate schema service: Avro schema registry with content-addressed dedup and backward-compatibility checks (including Iceberg-style union constraints).

This means schema governance is available but not in the append critical path of the broker.

= Data Plane Algorithms

== Append State

Append execution uses four state machines:

- in-flight coalescing keyed by `(writer_id, append_seq)`,
- dedup cache plus durable writer state,
- merge buffer keyed by `(topic, partition, schema)`,
- backpressure gate based on high/low-water thresholds.

  caption: [Algorithm A1: A(w,s,B) append admission and dedup path.],
  placement: top,
  block(
    inset: 6pt,
    stroke: 0.35pt + luma(200),
    radius: 2pt,
    [
*Inputs:* writer w, sequence s, batches B.
*State:* in-flight map I, dedup state D, queue Q.

1. If ACL denies (w,B), return E_auth.
2. If (w,s) exists in I, wait on the existing outcome and return it.
3. If backpressure gate is active, return E_backpressure.
4. Query dedup state: d := D.check(w,s).
5. If d = duplicate(acks), return success with prior acks.
6. If d = stale and there is no higher in-flight sequence for w, return E_stale_seq.
7. If dedup lookup errors, continue (fail-open path).
8. Enqueue (w,s,B) into Q, await flush outcome.
9. On success, update D with (w,s,acks) and return success; otherwise return retryable internal error.
],
  ),
)

Code-grounded detail: stale sequences are normally rejected, but a stale request can proceed when a higher sequence for the same writer is already in flight.

  caption: [Algorithm A2: F() flush and commit order.],

*Trigger set:* size threshold, dwell-time threshold, explicit flush, periodic tick.

1. Drain buffer into batch set U; if U is empty, stop.
2. Encode U into one payload object and persist to object storage.
3. If object write fails, fail pending requests in U.
4. Begin metadata transaction.
5. Aggregate per-partition record deltas.
6. Upsert partition_offsets with additive deltas and return updated next_offset.
7. Derive contiguous ranges for each batch in partition order.
8. Insert batch index rows into topic_batches.
9. Upsert latest writer dedup rows into writer_state.
10. Commit transaction.
11. On commit success, compute and return acknowledgments.
12. On commit failure, return errors; payload object may be orphaned until cleanup.
],
  ),
)

== Read Path

Read is metadata-first and object-range-second. For each requested partition, the broker queries at most 10 index rows with `end_offset > requested_offset`, then range-reads corresponding bytes and verifies checksums.

#figure(
  caption: [Algorithm R: R(Q) read with schema-aware grouping.],
  placement: top,
  block(
    inset: 6pt,
    stroke: 0.35pt + luma(200),
    radius: 2pt,
    [
*Input:* read vector Q = {(topic,partition,offset,max_bytes)}.

1. For each query q in Q, scan index rows ordered by start_offset, limit 10.
2. Fetch high_watermark := next_offset(topic,partition).
3. For each index row, range-read bytes and verify checksum while decoding records.
4. Skip records below requested offset.
5. Append decoded records until byte budget is reached.
6. Emit results grouped by contiguous schema-id runs; include high_watermark on each emitted partition result.

high_watermark is a visibility frontier, not a returned-record count.
],
  ),
)

= Control Plane: Reader Groups

Reader-group coordination is lease-based and generation-fenced in metadata tables.

- join_group: register member, bump generation, compute deterministic range assignment from sorted readers, claim unowned/expired leases.
- heartbeat: renew membership and lease TTL, evict expired members, bump generation on shrink.
- rejoin: reconcile owned vs target partitions.
- commit_offset: conditional update requiring owner and generation equality.

#figure(
  caption: [Algorithm G: J/H/RJ/C group operations.],
  placement: top,
  block(
    inset: 6pt,
    stroke: 0.35pt + luma(200),
    radius: 2pt,
    [
*Join J(g,t,r)*
1. Ensure group rows exist for (g,t).
2. Upsert member heartbeat for r.
3. Increment group generation.
4. Compute target(r) by deterministic range assignment over sorted members.
5. Claim only partitions whose lease is unowned or expired.

*Heartbeat H(g,t,r,gen)*
1. Refresh member heartbeat.
2. Renew leases owned by r.
3. Remove expired members and release their leases.
4. If membership changed, increment generation and return rebalance-needed.

*Rejoin RJ(g,t,r,gen)*
1. If gen is stale, return rebalance-needed.
2. Compute target(r); read owned(r).
3. Release owned - target, renew owned inter target, claim target - owned when claimable.

*Commit C(g,t,r,gen,p,off)*
1. Update committed offset iff owner is r and both assignment generation and group generation equal gen.
2. Otherwise classify as stale-generation or not-owner.
],
  ),
)

SDK note: auto-rebalancing behavior is client-assisted. The GroupReader starts a heartbeat loop, reacts to rebalance-needed responses, then executes rejoin with delay and retries.

Artifact caveats:

- `join_group` currently consumes only the first topic ID in the request.
- `commit` requests are handled entry-by-entry; multi-partition commit response is not atomic.

= Correctness Guarantees

Guarantees are under the crash-stop model above.

== Theorem 1 (Partition Offset Integrity)

Committed offsets in each partition are contiguous and non-overlapping.

*Proof sketch.* Offset deltas are aggregated and committed in one transaction. Batch ranges are derived from transactional `next_offset` results. Failed transactions publish no new offsets or index rows.

== Theorem 2 (Append Ack Discipline)

A successful append acknowledgment implies durable payload bytes and committed metadata index rows.

*Proof sketch.* Acknowledgments are distributed only after object write succeeds and metadata transaction commits.

== Theorem 3 (Writer Retry Idempotence)

For a fixed writer identity, replaying a sequence number resolves to the original logical append.

*Proof sketch.* Duplicate requests are either coalesced in-flight or resolved from durable writer state (`last_seq`, `last_acks`).

== Theorem 4 (Eventual Single Owner per Partition)

With bounded skew, lease expiry, and stable membership, ownership converges to one reader per `(group, topic, partition)`.

*Proof sketch.* Claim predicates require unowned/expired leases; generation fencing prevents stale owners from committing post-rebalance.

= Explicit Non-Guarantees

- No atomic two-phase commit spans object store and metadata store.
- Metadata failure after payload write can leave orphan payload objects.
- Exactly-once is writer-scoped idempotence, not global cross-writer EOS.
- Multi-partition commit requests can partially succeed.
- Relative order across independently merged schema buckets requires application-level constraints.

#set page(columns: 2)

Interpretation notes:

- Flourine and Bufstream are close architectural peers in separating payload durability from metadata coordination.
- Flourine's distinctive focus in this artifact is transactional offset-index publication with explicit writer-state dedup in metadata tables.
- Region-failure behavior for all systems is deployment-dependent; matrix entries describe documented mechanisms, not universal defaults.

= Evaluation Priorities

A VLDB-grade empirical section should prioritize:

- *Availability under regional faults:* measure write/read continuity through metadata-writer failover and object-store regional impairments.
- *Exactly-once boundaries:* quantify duplicate/loss behavior under client retry, broker crash, and commit-path failures.
- *Schema-governance cost:* compare append-path latency with and without broker-inline schema validation.
- *Group stability:* churn experiments on rebalance latency, partition movement, and commit fencing under load.

Current artifact evidence supports functional safety claims through integration and fault-oriented tests, but does not yet establish comparative throughput leadership.

= Threats to Validity

- Metadata failover behavior depends on the selected managed service and topology.
- Object-store replication policy directly affects region-level recovery point objectives.
- Consumer-group outcomes depend on client heartbeat cadence, timeout settings, and retry policies.
- Cross-system comparisons are sensitive to configuration parity and workload shape.

= Related Work

Kafka established the partitioned replicated-log model and later idempotent/transactional semantics for stronger delivery guarantees [1, 2, 3]. Redpanda provides Kafka-protocol compatibility with Raft-backed internals, Kafka-compatible transactions, and schema-registry support [4, 5, 6]. Bufstream is an object-storage-centric Kafka-compatible system with documented EOS support, schema-governance features, and multi-region claims [7, 8, 9]. Flourine contributes a code-explicit transactional offset-index model with stateless brokers and metadata-centric fencing.

= Conclusion

Flourine is best understood as a metadata-centric event bus over object-stored payloads. Its strongest implemented properties are partition-level offset integrity, post-commit acknowledgment discipline, writer-scoped idempotence, and generation-fenced reader ownership. The main open systems problem remains the non-atomic boundary between payload and metadata stores. Future work should pair regional-failure experiments with formal recovery invariants and side-by-side benchmarks under matched workloads.

== A.1 Writer Ack and Retry

#figure(
  caption: [Algorithm AW1: Writer append with retry and backpressure handling.],
  placement: top,

append_seq <- atomic_fetch_add(next_seq, 1)
retries <- 0
backoff <- initial_backoff

loop:

  if result == OK(acks):
    return OK(acks)

  if result == BACKPRESSURE:
    if retries >= max_retries:
      return BACKPRESSURE
    sleep(backoff)
    backoff <- min(backoff * 2, max_backoff)
    retries <- retries + 1
    continue

  return result
```
    ],
  ),
)

*Failure Walkthrough.*
- Backpressure is retried with exponential backoff using the same `append_seq`.
- Timeout or disconnection returns an error to the caller; application-level retry can resend with the same writer identity and sequence semantics.
- Late responses after local timeout are ignored by the pending map once the pending entry is removed.

*Failure Walkthrough.*
- Pending state is cleaned on send failure and timeout.
- The writer uses response demultiplexing keyed by `append_seq`.

    return OK(acks)
  else:
    CompleteInFlight(writer_id, append_seq, INTERNAL_ERROR)
    return INTERNAL_ERROR
```
    ],
  ),
)

*Failure Walkthrough.*
- Duplicate concurrent requests coalesce at in-flight state and share one outcome.
- Dedup lookup failure does not block append (fail-open), which favors availability over strict reject-on-dedup-error behavior.
- Stale sequence handling has an exception path when a higher sequence is already in flight.

== A.3 Broker Flush, Commit, and Ack Distribution

    ],
  ),
)

*Failure Walkthrough.*
- Object-write failure prevents metadata publication and success acknowledgments.
- Transaction failure after object write yields no success acknowledgments; payload cleanup is deferred.
- Acknowledgments are emitted only after successful transaction commit.
- Backpressure is set at high-water and released at low-water after successful drain progression.

== A.4 Broker Read Path

#figure(

    stop if byte budget reached

  emit grouped partition results with high_watermark
  if no records, emit empty partition result

return results
```
    ],
  ),
)

*Failure Walkthrough.*
- Range-read or decode failure currently fails the read request path and returns a read error response.
- `high_watermark` can exceed returned record count when byte budget truncates output.
- Result grouping may emit multiple partition result entries for one partition when schema ID boundaries are crossed.

  if r.records non-empty:
    local_offsets[r.partition] <- local_offsets[r.partition] + len(r.records)

return results
```
    ],
  ),
)

*Failure Walkthrough.*
- Offset advancement is client-side and based on returned record count.
- Commit is explicit and separate; uncommitted progress may be replayed on restart/rejoin.

#figure(

    continue

  assignments <- rj.assignments
  local_offsets <- committed offsets from assignments
  generation <- rj.generation
  state <- ACTIVE
  return
```
    ],
  ),
)

*Failure Walkthrough.*
- `UNKNOWN_MEMBER` triggers a fresh join, which can reset local assignment state.
- Commit during rebalance/leave is best-effort; failures are logged and processing continues.
- Rejoin can spin through multiple generations under sustained group churn.
